    1.	Bring a pan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the broccoli and boil for 1 min 30 secs, or until tender. 
        Drain and set aside. Cook the pasta following pack instructions, then drain, reserving a ladleful of cooking water.<br><br>

    2.	Heat the oil in a large frying pan, add the garlic clove and fry over a low heat for 2 mins. Remove with a slotted spoon and discard, leaving the flavoured oil.<br><br>
    
    3.	Add the tomatoes to the pan and fry over a medium heat for 5 mins, or until beginning to soften and turn juicy. Stir through the prawns and cook for 2 mins, or until turning pink. 
        Stir through the broccoli and add the harissa and lemon zest, stirring to coat.<br><br>
    
    4.	Toss the cooked spaghetti through the prawns and harissa, adding a splash of the pasta water to loosen sauce if needed. Season to taste and serve.<br><br>
    
    o	Enjoy!
