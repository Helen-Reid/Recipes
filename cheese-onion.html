<h2>Method:</h2>
<p class = "intext">
<intext>
    1.	Preheat the oven to gas mark 5 (180C if using fan oven). Add a knob of butter to a frying pan on a medium/low heat, when melted, add the onion. Cook, stirring often, until softened, then add the garlic and cook for a few minutes longer until fragrant before seasoning well. 
    Add the paprika and continue to cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Meanwhile, par-boil the potatoes in salted water for around 6 - 8 minutes, the potato doesn’t need to be fully cooked at this stage as it will cook further in the oven.<br><br>

    2.	Remove onion mixture from the heat and drain potatoes before setting aside and allowing to cool. When cool, add to a bowl, together with the cheese and the cayenne pepper, adding a pinch of salt and black pepper; mix to combine.<br><br>
    
    3.	Unfurl the pastry and cut into 4 rectangular pieces. Place 1.5 serving spoon-fulls of filling within 1 half of your rectangles, leaving a 1 ½ cm rim on the outside. Dampen the rim with a little water, then bring over the other half of the pastry rectangle to enclose the filling. 
    Crimp together the seams either using your fingers or by pressing with the prongs of a fork to seal. Repeat this process with remainder filling/pastry.<br><br>
    
    4.	Place the pastries on a sheet of baking tray lined with baking paper. Brush each with the beaten egg, then poke the centre with the tip of a sharp knife (this hole will allow air to escape while they are cooking). 
    Transfer to the oven and cook for 30-35 minutes, or until golden brown.<br><br>

    o	Allow to cool atleast 15-20 minutes out of the oven before handling. Enjoy warm or cold!
