<p>These are the roasties you've always dreamed of! Tried, tested and 
    a winner every time (with-out fail). <br>This recipe serves enough for five-six, but if you know what's good for you, you should
    definitely make enough for left-overs. Thank us later!

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<p class = "intext">
<intext>- 1.5 kg baking potatoes (Maris Pipers work well, though any baking potato will do)<br>
- 3 tbsp butter<br>
- 1 tsp chilli flakes<br>
- 3.5 tsp dried thyme<br>
- vegetable oil (sunflower oil will work too!) <br>
- salt<br>
- black pepper<br>
</intext>
<h2>Method:</h2>
<p class = "intext">
<intext> 1.	Preheat oven to 170°C (170°C fan) gas mark 8. Peel and cut the potatoes into large, even-sized chunks (about 5cm/2in). 
Put into a pan, cover with cold water and a lid. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat a little, take off the lid and simmer for 8min.<br><br>
2.	Meanwhile, in a bowl mix in the butter, chilli flakes, thyme, 1tsp salt (ideally flaked rock salt) and lots of freshly ground black pepper.<br><br>
3.	Drain the potatoes and leave to steam dry for 5min. Toss in the colander a few times or very gently mash to rough up the edges
before emptying into a large roasting tin. Toss through the butter mixture, before drizzling with enough oil to coat the potatoes.<br><br>
4.	Roast in the oven for 1¼ (this may be longer depending on oven-type as tempes may vary!), turning every 20 min until golden, adding a little oil if looking dry.<br> 
    <br>Transfer to a warmed serving bowl and enjoy!<br><br>
    o	Top tip! Use remaining butter mixture to finish sprouts!
